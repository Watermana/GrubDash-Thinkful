# GrubDash-Thinkful
GrubDash project for Thinkul

# Purpose
GrubDash is a backend express server with similar functionality to a food delivery app, like DoorDash.

# Uses
GrubDash could be used as the backend to a food delivery service application, connected to a react frontend.

# Functionality 
This is a basic Express server that can CRUD (create, read, update, delete) data.
Data is stored in JSON format as either dishes or orders.
The express server stores pre-existing orders and dishes in a JSON file and saves subsequent changes in memory.

# Technologies Used
This project uses JavaScript ES6, built with Express.js and Node.js. It uses nodemon for development monitoring and
jest for unit testing.

# Future Goals
My future goals for this project is to connect it to a PostgreSQL data base to store data when the server is not
running, and to create a React frontend to interface with it.
